You can also import fiddler key into java trusted certificates store:

    Export Fiddler's root certificate

    Tools -> Fiddler Options... -> HTTPS -> Actions -> Export Root Certificate to Desktop

    Run as admin:

"keytool.exe" -import -noprompt -trustcacerts -alias FiddlerRoot -file c:\work\FiddlerRoot.cer -keystore "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_79\jre\lib\security\cacerts" -storepass changeit

Also I had a problem with decrypting https traffic of Google API Client with Fiddler. The problem was that by default it uses it's own cert store:

InputStream keyStoreStream = GoogleUtils.class.getResourceAsStream("google.jks");
SecurityUtils.loadKeyStore(certTrustStore, keyStoreStream, "notasecret");

And this is how i fixed this:

 HttpTransport transport = new NetHttpTransport()
 //istead of transport = GoogleNetHttpTransport.newTrustedTransport();
